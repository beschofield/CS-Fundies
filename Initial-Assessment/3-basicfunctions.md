# 3: Basic Functions

*Note: use the C++ reference guide as your only external resource (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)*

## Problem

Write a simple calculator program, working with two inputted integers.

Each operation will have its own function: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The main function will simply be used to call the various operations.
You should have the user input the name of the desired operation and the two integers. (the order of this is trivial)

Do not worry about handling unusual input. You can safely assume that the user will desire two integers in all cases.

## Examples

### Input
```
3
2
addition
```

### Output
```
5
```

### Input
```
9
2
division
```

### Output
```
4
```
