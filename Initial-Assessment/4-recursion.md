# 4: Recursion

*Note: use the C++ reference guide as your only external resource (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)*

## Problem

Write a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

You must solve this problem using recursion, you may not use a loop anywhere in the Fibonacci function. You will need to take in user input, which will be an integer specifying the desired Fibonacci number to return.

Use the definition of the Fibonacci sequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) starting at 0.

## Examples

### Input
```
3
10
1
```

### Output
```
1
34
0
```
